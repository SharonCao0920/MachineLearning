### Supervised Learning
**A. Classification:**
It is a Supervised Learning task where output is having defined labels(discrete value). The goal here is to predict discrete values belonging to a particular class and evaluate them on the basis of accuracy. 

**B. Regression:**
It is a Supervised Learning task where output is having continuous value. The goal here is to predict a value as much closer to the actual output value as our model can and then evaluation is done by calculating the error value. The smaller the error the greater the accuracy of our regression model.

**Example of Supervised Learning Algorithms:**
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Nearest Neighbor
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest

### Linear Regression with Normal Equation
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.
